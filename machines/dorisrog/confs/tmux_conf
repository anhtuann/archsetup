# This configuration file binds many of the common GNU screen key bindings to
# appropriate tmux key bindings. Note that for some key bindings there is no
# tmux analogue and also that this set omits binding some commands available in
# tmux but not in screen.
#
# Note this is only a selection of key bindings and they are in addition to the
# normal tmux key bindings. This is intended as an example not as to be used
# as-is.

# Set the prefix to ^A.
#unbind C-b
#set -g prefix ^A
#bind a send-prefix

# start numbering at 1, which eases window switch by number (C-a 1, C-a 2)
set -g base-index 1      

# screen ^C c 
unbind ^C
bind ^C new-window
unbind c
bind c new-window

# detach ^D d
unbind ^D
bind ^D detach
